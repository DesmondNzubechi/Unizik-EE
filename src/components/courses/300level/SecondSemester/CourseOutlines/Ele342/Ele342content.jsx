Field solutions of an elementary electric dipole radiation from current distribution and arrays diffraction and interference. Guided electromagnetic waves on continuous transmission lines. Periodic structures and metallic wave guides or propagation and evanescence, energy and group velocity. Natural frequencies and modes and closed electromagnetic structure coupling to resonant structures. Load and unloaded Qâ€™s. Example throughout taken from the field of acoustic optics and microwaves.
