    <p className="md:text-[20px] text-[17px] font-[400] ">Anambra State University of Technology (ASUTECH) was established by law in July, 1980 as the first indigenous University of Technology in Nigeria. From the onset, two campuses were opened simultaneously at Enugu and Awka. The Department of Electrical/Electronic and Computer Engineering was sited at the Enugu Campus during the 1980/81session. With the creation of Enugu State out of the old Anambra State in August, 1991, the ASUTECH was re-established at Awka with the former curriculum of ASUTECH. In 1990 the University was renamed Nnamdi Azikiwe University. In 1992, the Federal Government of Nigeria took over the University. Earlier than then, the programme of the Department had an initial accreditation at ASUTECH Enugu. </p>
